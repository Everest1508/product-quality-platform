## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-04

### Security

- **Per-product access is now enforced on the company-wide ticket views.** The
  global ticket board, list, detail page, and every mutation endpoint
  (status, priority, assign, comment, deadline, edit, delete, bulk-delete)
  filtered only by company. Any member — including one with no `ProductAccess`
  at all — could see and modify tickets belonging to products they were never
  granted. All of these now scope to `accessible_products` and 404 on tickets
  outside the caller's reach. Owners and admins are unaffected.
- **Same fix for the company-wide error views** (`apps/errors/views.py`): list,
  detail, status change, ignore, resolve, convert-to-ticket, and delete now
  enforce product access.
- The ticket and error "create" forms restrict the product dropdown to products
  the user can access, and the product-scoped create views reject a mismatched
  product in the POST body.

### Added

- `apps/products/access.py`: `accessible_tickets` / `require_ticket_access` and
  `accessible_error_groups` / `require_error_group_access` helpers.
- **Product switcher** in the sidebar — jump between accessible products without
  returning to the product list.
- **User menu** pinned to the sidebar footer (initials avatar + name + role →
  Settings, Sign out), replacing the bare "Sign out" button.
- **Collapsible sidebar** — toggles to a 60px icon rail with hover tooltips;
  state persists in `localStorage` and applies before first paint.
- **Mobile navigation** — the sidebar becomes an off-canvas drawer with a
  backdrop, opened from a hamburger in a new sticky top bar. `Escape` or a
  backdrop tap closes it. Page headers, tab strips, and toolbars now wrap
  instead of clipping off-screen on narrow viewports.
- **Breadcrumbs** on product ticket/error list, kanban, and detail pages.
- Company-wide open-ticket / open-error count badges on the primary nav.
- Regression tests: `TicketProductAccessTest`, `ErrorProductAccessTest`.

### Changed

- The company-wide boards are now clearly labelled **"All tickets"** and
  **"All errors"** (page title, breadcrumb, `every product` scope note in the
  header). The sidebar entries were renamed to match, and the primary nav
  (`Home · Products · All tickets · All errors · Reports`) is now identical in
  every context instead of reshuffling when you enter or leave a product.
- **Sidebar rebuilt**: icons on every row, a visible active state (accent fill +
  left bar), and grouped sections (`Operations`, `Admin`). Settings moved out of
  the flat list into the user menu.
- The **Kanban ⇄ List** toggle now carries the active filters across the switch.
- **Kanban board**: height is bounded to the viewport so the horizontal
  scrollbar stays on screen; the scrollbar is themed; columns scroll-snap.
  Overdue tickets show one indicator (`Overdue · <date>`) instead of a badge
  and a red date.
- The **"Delete Tickets"** button (a selection-mode toggle) is relabelled
  **"Select"**.
- Assignee avatar chips render as intended — the `--accent` / `--accent-soft`
  design tokens they referenced were never defined; they now are.

### Fixed

- Product error and ticket counts in the sidebar collapsed to `0` on every
  product page except Overview, because those views passed a bare `product`
  that shadowed the count-annotated one from the context processor. The
  ticket/error views now attach counts explicitly.
- `TicketDetailView` returned **HTTP 500** on any `HX-Request` GET to
  `/tickets/<pk>/` — it rendered `tickets/partials/_ticket_detail_content.html`,
  which has never existed. No caller relied on it; the dead branch was removed.
- `test_sidebar_renders_company_switcher` updated for the renamed switcher CSS
  class (`org-switch` → `switch`).

### Known issues (pre-existing, not addressed here)

- `apps.accounts.tests.test_tenant_isolation`: `test_signup_creates_user`
  (`NoReverseMatch` for `accounts:signup`) and `test_request_has_company_after_login`
  (expects 200, the root view now redirects). Both are stale tests against
  refactored auth flow, unrelated to the changes above.
